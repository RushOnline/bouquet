[Network] Stream packet parser/generator, fork from FLAVOR (Formal Language for Audio-Visual Object Representation)

Object-oriented media representation language designed for simplifying the development of applications that
involve a significant stream processing component (encoding, decoding, editing, manipulation, etc.).
It provides a formal way for describing any coded audio-visual or general multimedia bitstream, and it comes with
a translator that can automatically generate C++ code from the Flavor description.
The generated code can readily be used as a bitstream parser, generator or tracing tool.
